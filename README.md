A platformer game I created in early 2019 (donâ€™t judge *too* harshly, it was only my second year as a Computer Science student!)

It uses ImpactJS, an old open source JavaScript game engine.

Fight enemies by kicking them with 'Q', drop-kicking them by running and clicking 'W', and generate an energy orb to kick at them with 'E'. Also, use 'A' and 'W' to move left and right, and 'space' to jump.
